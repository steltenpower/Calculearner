## 1: Calculators to maybe help learn the abstraction of amounts coded in digits; by seeing those change at the same time.

(photos of paper prototypes. Annoyingly rotated sometimes)


#### 1a: How numbers are constructed from digits and how to pronounce them in Dutch

Shifting 'tens' and 'ones', to create a number while showing THAT amount of dots

very similar, but not put together

#### 1b: Add and substract (being 2 directions of the same thing):

#### 1c2: multiplication, simpler in 2 layers instead of 3<a name="multiplication_2layer"></a>
I drew and cut this. Not photographed yet

#### 1c3: multiplication, a static matrix <a name="multiplication_static"></a>
Have 2 perpendicular axis, both going from 0 to 66, with the distance between the ticks being 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11 and that number written between the ticks. Not extend those ticks into lines all the way through the matrix. A variation on https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3f/Multiplication_table_to_scale.svg


Some technical hints to make it interactively on-line:

## 2: Numbered kid juwelry
- Rings/bracelets that show digits (similar to what's on combination lock). With a viewing window to read the number from and to keep 2 rings together. Highlight zeroes as those trigger 'carry over'.
- Necklace with beads that each have a number, starting with zero and from there add one every time


## 3: Font of characters kids learn writing, so I can type a text that kid can practice to write

## 4: Pattern Recognition that does ping or BUZZ based on handwritten or spoken plus/minus calculations on 2 numbers, each of maximum 2 digits.
