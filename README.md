- Rings to put on fingers that show digits (similar to what's on combination lock). With a viewing window to read the number from and to keep 2 rings together. Highlight zero as that's what triggers the 'carry over' (correct name?)

- Shifting 'tens' surface and 'ones' surface, to create a number while showing THAT amount of dots
