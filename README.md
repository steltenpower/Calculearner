# Elementary School Gimmicks
When I noticed a young kid able to do simple calculations with things, depictions and spoken numbers significantly better than with amounts written in digits, I wondered if learning could be helped by making the abstractions that digits are, explicit WITHIN doing calculations. This resulated in designs for 3 'machines', where every number is always also represented in an amount of depictions:

- Numbers expressed in the alfabet (in Dutch):

#### 1a: How numbers are constructed from digits and how to pronounce them in Dutch

Shifting 'tens' and 'ones', to create a number while showing THAT amount of dots

#### 1b: Add and substract (being 2 directions of the same thing):

#### 1c2: multiplication, simpler in 2 layers instead of 3<a name="multiplication_2layer"></a>
I drew and cut this. Not photographed yet

#### 1c3: multiplication, a static matrix <a name="multiplication_static"></a>

Some technical hints to make it interactively on-line:
- https://www.sitepoint.com/masking-in-the-browser-with-css-and-svg/
- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute/fill-rule#Example_2

## 2: Numbered kid juwelry
- Rings/bracelets that show digits (similar to what's on combination lock). With a viewing window to read the number from and to keep 2 rings together. Highlight zeroes as those trigger 'carry over'.
- Necklace with beads that each have a number, starting with zero and from there add one every time


## 3: Font of characters kids learn writing, so I can type a text that kid can practice to write

## 4: Pattern Recognition that does ping or BUZZ based on handwritten or spoken plus/minus calculations on 2 numbers, each of maximum 2 digits.
