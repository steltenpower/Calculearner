## 1: Calculators to maybe help learn the abstraction of amounts coded in digits; by seeing those change at the same time.

(photos of paper prototypes. Annoyingly rotated sometimes)


#### 1a: How numbers are constructed from digits and how to pronounce them in Dutch

Shifting 'tens' and 'ones', to create a number while showing THAT amount of dots

very similar, but not put together

#### 1b: Add and substract (being 2 directions of the same thing):

## 2: Numbered kid juwelry
- Rings/bracelets that show digits (similar to what's on combination lock). With a viewing window to read the number from and to keep 2 rings together. Highlight zeroes as those trigger 'carry over'.
- Necklace with beads that each have a number, starting with zero and from there add one every time


## 3: Font of characters kids learn writing, so I can type a text that kid can practice to write
