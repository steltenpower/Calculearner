## Calculators to maybe help learn the abstraction of amounts coded in digits; by seeing those change simultaneously

(photos of paper quick&dirty prototypes. Annoyingly rotated sometimes)

## Numbered kid juwelry
- Rings/bracelets that show digits (similar to what's on combination lock). With a viewing window to read the number from and to keep 2 rings together. Highlight zeroes as those trigger 'carry over'.
- Necklace with beads that each have a number, starting with zero and from there add one every time


-  Font of characters kids learn writing, so I can type a text that kid can practice to write
